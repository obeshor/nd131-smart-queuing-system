# Smart queuing system
Deploy custom queuing AI systems for the retail, manufacturing and transportation scenarios and use the IntelÂ® DevCloud to test solutions performance.

This project propose a possible hardware solution. Build application and test its performance on the DevCloud using multiple hardwares. Compare the performance to see which hardware performed best.

# Requirement
This project requires Intel Dev Cloud to test the model performance before buying any hardware. 
Open VINO Version: v2020.1 is required
